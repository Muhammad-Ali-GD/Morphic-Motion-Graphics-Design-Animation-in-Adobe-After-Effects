# Morphic-Motion-Graphics-Design-Animation-in-Adobe-After-Effects

Each motion graphic animation has something unique and classy. Ro create a morphic design animation, we use the shapes of same color as that of the video background but it does not mean that our image becomes invisible, instead we apply effects like drop shadow and of opposite color at one angle of the shape and of same color at the other end. The rest of the animation is simple. We just use animations to further animate those shapes to create a classic look.

These type of animations can be used to animate anything. Here, I animated a simple logo clearifying the depth of the motion graphics animation.
